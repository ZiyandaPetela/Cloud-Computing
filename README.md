# Module 1:Cloud Computing Fundamentals
# Understanding Cloud Concepts
* Cloud computing refers to the use of hosted services, such as data storage, servers,  databases, networking, and software over the internet. 
* The data is stored on physical servers, which are maintained by a cloud service 
provider. Computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, are available on-demand, without direct management by the user in cloud computing.

* Instead of storing files on a storage device or hard drive, a user can save them on cloud, making it possible to access the files from anywhere, as long as they have access to the web. 
* The services hosted on cloud can be broadly divided into infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). 
* Based on the deployment model, cloud can also be classified as public, private, and hybrid cloud.
