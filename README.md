# Module 1:Cloud Computing Fundamentals
# Understanding Cloud Concepts

* Cloud computing refers to the use of hosted services, such as data storage, servers,  databases, networking, and software over the internet. 
* The data is stored on physical servers, which are maintained by a cloud service 
provider. Computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, are available on-demand, without direct management by the user in cloud computing.

* Instead of storing files on a storage device or hard drive, a user can save them on cloud, making it possible to access the files from anywhere, as long as they have access to the web. 
* The services hosted on cloud can be broadly divided into infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). 
* Based on the deployment model, cloud can also be classified as public, private, and hybrid cloud.
* Further, cloud can be divided into two different layers, namely, front-end and back-end. The layer with which users interact is called the front-end layer.
*  This layer enables a user to access the data that has been stored in cloud through cloud computing software
*  The layer made up of software and hardware, i.e., the computers, servers, central servers, and databases, is the back-end layer.
*   This layer is the primary component of cloud and is entirely responsible for storing information securely.
*   To ensure seamless connectivity between devices linked via cloud computing, the central servers use a software called middlewareOpens a new window  that acts as a bridge between the database and applications.

### The five characteristics defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are,basic understanding of what cloud computing means. These characteristics help to illustrate cloud services:

#### On-Demand Self-Service
* Consumers can provision resources as needed and automatically. Cloud services consumers can provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to work with the CSP (Cloud service provider) directly. These resources might include additional compute power, additional storage, new websites, or even database services. The consumer can expand (or reduce) these services without the need for human assistance from the CSP.
* On-Demand Self-Service is one of the core characteristics that illustrate cloud services. This characteristic allows users to provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, automatically as needed without requiring human interaction with each service provider. Here’s how it helps illustrate cloud services:
* User Empowerment:
* Immediate Access: Users can access and deploy cloud resources instantly whenever they need them, eliminating the wait times associated with traditional IT provisioning.
Self-Management: Users can manage their own computing needs directly through a web interface or API without needing to go through a centralized IT department.
* Efficiency and Flexibility:
* Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down on demand to meet varying workloads, ensuring that users only pay for what they use.
Elasticity: The ability to quickly adapt to changes in demand helps businesses to stay agile and responsive to market needs.
* Cost Management:
* Cost Control: By enabling users to start and stop resources as needed, it helps in managing costs more effectively. Users can avoid paying for idle resources.
Pay-As-You-Go Model: Cloud services typically operate on a pay-as-you-go model, where users are billed based on their consumption, promoting cost efficiency.
* Automation and Simplification:
* Automated Provisioning: The process of provisioning resources is automated, which reduces the complexity and potential for human error.
Simplified IT Operations: On-demand self-service abstracts much of the underlying infrastructure management, simplifying IT operations and allowing IT staff to focus on more strategic tasks.
* Rapid Innovation:
* Speed of Deployment: New applications and services can be deployed rapidly, accelerating the pace of innovation.
Experimentation: Users can easily test and experiment with new ideas and technologies without a significant upfront investment.
By embodying these attributes, on-demand self-service makes cloud computing a powerful, efficient, and flexible solution for businesses and individuals alike

####Broad Network Acces
* Services are available across the network from commonly available clients. Client devices and traditional server deployments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network. The network might include the local on-premises network or the Internet, or both. Cloud resources have the potential to be globally accessible.
* Broad Network Access is another fundamental characteristic of cloud services. It refers to the capability to access cloud services over the network (e.g., the internet) using various types of devices. Here’s how this characteristic helps illustrate cloud services:
* Accessibility:
* Ubiquitous Access: Cloud services can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, providing ubiquitous access to resources and applications.
Device Independence: Users can access services using a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops, as well as other network-capable devices.
* Flexibility and Mobility:
* Work from Anywhere: Users are not tied to a specific location or device, enabling remote work and enhancing productivity.
Collaboration: Teams can collaborate in real-time from different geographic locations, improving communication and efficiency
* By leveraging broad network access, cloud services become highly accessible, flexible, and efficient, supporting a wide range of use cases and enabling new ways of working and collaborating.

#### Resource Pooling
* The cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model and adjusts resource allocation on an on-demand basis, and the specific distribution of hardware resources is abstracted from the consumer. CSPs pool network, storage, and compute capabilities and then dynamically and automatically allocate those resources to consumers on an on-demand basis. The consumers do not know (or care) where the resources might physically be located. The next time those services are used by the consumer, the resource locations might have changed. The CSP manages the resources and maximizes their use.
* Resource Pooling is a key characteristic of cloud services that highlights the ability to serve multiple customers (or tenants) with scalable and dynamically allocated resources.
* This characteristic involves pooling computing resources such as storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth to serve many users, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand
* Multi-Tenancy:
* Shared Infrastructure: Multiple customers share the same physical infrastructure while maintaining logical separation to ensure security and privacy. This sharing maximizes resource utilization and efficiency.
Isolation: Each tenant’s data and applications are isolated from others, ensuring privacy and security even in a shared environment.
* Dynamic Allocation:
* Elasticity: Resources are dynamically allocated and reallocated based on user demand. For example, if a particular service experiences a spike in usage, additional resources can be allocated to maintain performance.
Scalability: The cloud infrastructure can scale up or down automatically to meet the current demand, providing the necessary resources when needed without manual intervention.
* By leveraging resource pooling, cloud services can provide efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solutions that meet the diverse needs of multiple users while ensuring high levels of performance and reliability.
#### Rapid Elasticity
* Resources are provisioned and released to adjust for changes in demand and consumption. This process may be automatic or manual. Server resources in a traditional model are purchased as a capital expenditure, and whether or not those resources are efficiently utilized, their cost and capabilities are fixed. In some business models, resource needs change throughout the year. For example, retail demand is significantly higher during some parts of the year than others. With cloud-based computing, resources are dynamically allocated, making for far more efficient utilization of those resources. Servers that might have been underutilized for most of the year no longer need to be purchased and maintained.
* Rapid Elasticity is another key characteristic of cloud services that emphasizes the ability to rapidly and dynamically scale resources up or down to meet fluctuating demand. This capability allows cloud users to quickly provision and release resources as needed, providing agility and cost efficiency.
* Overall, Rapid Elasticity enables cloud services to deliver scalability, agility, cost efficiency, and resilience, empowering organizations to innovate, grow, and respond to market dynamics with greater flexibility and speed.
#### Measured Service
* Measured Service is a fundamental characteristic of cloud services, highlighting the ability to monitor, control, and report resource usage accurately.
*  This characteristic ensures that both the cloud provider and the customer can track resource consumption, optimize performance, and manage costs effectively.
*  Usage Monitoring:
*  Resource Tracking: Cloud providers automatically track the usage of resources such as storage, processing power, bandwidth, and active user accounts.
Granular Data: Detailed data is collected at various levels of granularity, allowing for precise measurement of how resources are being used.
*  Transparency and Accountability:
*  Usage Reports: Customers receive detailed reports on their resource usage, which can be accessed through dashboards or APIs. These reports provide transparency and help customers understand their consumption patterns.
Billing and Invoicing: Accurate measurement of resource usage ensures that customers are billed correctly according to their actual consumption, aligning costs with usage.
* Measured Service ensures that cloud services are transparent, accountable, and optimized, providing customers with the data they need to manage their resources efficiently and cost-effectively while enabling providers to deliver reliable and high-quality services.

# Cloud Computing Ecosystem
* A Cloud Ecosystem refers to the interconnected network of cloud computing services, solutions, technologies, and providers that collectively enable the delivery, management, and consumption of cloud resources and services.
### How a cloud ecosystem works
* The center of a cloud ecosystem is a public cloud provider. It might be an IaaS provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or a SaaS vendor such as Salesforce.
*  Radiating out from the center of the cloud are software companies that use the provider's anchor platform, as well as consultants and companies that have formed strategic alliances with the anchor provider.
### The benefits of a cloud ecosystem
* Companies can use a cloud ecosystem to build new business models.
*  It becomes relatively easy for a medical device manufacturer, for example, to launch a heart-monitoring service on its cloud service provider's cloud infrastructure and then sell the service alongside its main business of manufacturing heart monitors for hospitals.
*  In a cloud ecosystem, it is also easier to aggregate data and analyze how each part of the system affects the other parts.
*   For example, if an ecosystem consists of patient records, smart device logs and healthcare provider records, it becomes possible to analyze patterns across an entire patient population.
#### It’s important to understand that an ecosystem of participants defines the market. This ecosystem consists of three categories of players:

### Understanding Cloud Concepts
* Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.
* Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).
* Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is.
*  That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.
