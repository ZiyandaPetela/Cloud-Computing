# Module 1:Cloud Computing Fundamentals
# Understanding Cloud Concepts

* Cloud computing refers to the use of hosted services, such as data storage, servers,  databases, networking, and software over the internet. 
* The data is stored on physical servers, which are maintained by a cloud service 
provider. Computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, are available on-demand, without direct management by the user in cloud computing.

* Instead of storing files on a storage device or hard drive, a user can save them on cloud, making it possible to access the files from anywhere, as long as they have access to the web. 
* The services hosted on cloud can be broadly divided into infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). 
* Based on the deployment model, cloud can also be classified as public, private, and hybrid cloud.
* Further, cloud can be divided into two different layers, namely, front-end and back-end. The layer with which users interact is called the front-end layer.
*  This layer enables a user to access the data that has been stored in cloud through cloud computing software
*  The layer made up of software and hardware, i.e., the computers, servers, central servers, and databases, is the back-end layer.
*   This layer is the primary component of cloud and is entirely responsible for storing information securely.
*   To ensure seamless connectivity between devices linked via cloud computing, the central servers use a software called middlewareOpens a new window  that acts as a bridge between the database and applications.

### The five characteristics defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are,basic understanding of what cloud computing means. These characteristics help to illustrate cloud services:

#### On-Demand Self-Service
* Consumers can provision resources as needed and automatically. Cloud services consumers can provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to work with the CSP (Cloud service provider) directly. These resources might include additional compute power, additional storage, new websites, or even database services. The consumer can expand (or reduce) these services without the need for human assistance from the CSP.
* On-Demand Self-Service is one of the core characteristics that illustrate cloud services. This characteristic allows users to provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, automatically as needed without requiring human interaction with each service provider. Here’s how it helps illustrate cloud services:
* User Empowerment:
* Immediate Access: Users can access and deploy cloud resources instantly whenever they need them, eliminating the wait times associated with traditional IT provisioning.
Self-Management: Users can manage their own computing needs directly through a web interface or API without needing to go through a centralized IT department.
* Efficiency and Flexibility:
* Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down on demand to meet varying workloads, ensuring that users only pay for what they use.
Elasticity: The ability to quickly adapt to changes in demand helps businesses to stay agile and responsive to market needs.
* Cost Management:
* Cost Control: By enabling users to start and stop resources as needed, it helps in managing costs more effectively. Users can avoid paying for idle resources.
Pay-As-You-Go Model: Cloud services typically operate on a pay-as-you-go model, where users are billed based on their consumption, promoting cost efficiency.
* Automation and Simplification:
* Automated Provisioning: The process of provisioning resources is automated, which reduces the complexity and potential for human error.
Simplified IT Operations: On-demand self-service abstracts much of the underlying infrastructure management, simplifying IT operations and allowing IT staff to focus on more strategic tasks.
* Rapid Innovation:
* Speed of Deployment: New applications and services can be deployed rapidly, accelerating the pace of innovation.
Experimentation: Users can easily test and experiment with new ideas and technologies without a significant upfront investment.
By embodying these attributes, on-demand self-service makes cloud computing a powerful, efficient, and flexible solution for businesses and individuals alike

####Broad Network Acces
* Services are available across the network from commonly available clients. Client devices and traditional server deployments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network. The network might include the local on-premises network or the Internet, or both. Cloud resources have the potential to be globally accessible.
* Broad Network Access is another fundamental characteristic of cloud services. It refers to the capability to access cloud services over the network (e.g., the internet) using various types of devices. Here’s how this characteristic helps illustrate cloud services:
* Accessibility:
* Ubiquitous Access: Cloud services can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, providing ubiquitous access to resources and applications.
Device Independence: Users can access services using a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops, as well as other network-capable devices.
* Flexibility and Mobility:
* Work from Anywhere: Users are not tied to a specific location or device, enabling remote work and enhancing productivity.
Collaboration: Teams can collaborate in real-time from different geographic locations, improving communication and efficiency
* By leveraging broad network access, cloud services become highly accessible, flexible, and efficient, supporting a wide range of use cases and enabling new ways of working and collaborating.

#### Resource Pooling
* The cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model and adjusts resource allocation on an on-demand basis, and the specific distribution of hardware resources is abstracted from the consumer. CSPs pool network, storage, and compute capabilities and then dynamically and automatically allocate those resources to consumers on an on-demand basis. The consumers do not know (or care) where the resources might physically be located. The next time those services are used by the consumer, the resource locations might have changed. The CSP manages the resources and maximizes their use.
* Resource Pooling is a key characteristic of cloud services that highlights the ability to serve multiple customers (or tenants) with scalable and dynamically allocated resources.
* This characteristic involves pooling computing resources such as storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth to serve many users, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand
* Multi-Tenancy:
* Shared Infrastructure: Multiple customers share the same physical infrastructure while maintaining logical separation to ensure security and privacy. This sharing maximizes resource utilization and efficiency.
Isolation: Each tenant’s data and applications are isolated from others, ensuring privacy and security even in a shared environment.
* Dynamic Allocation:
* Elasticity: Resources are dynamically allocated and reallocated based on user demand. For example, if a particular service experiences a spike in usage, additional resources can be allocated to maintain performance.
Scalability: The cloud infrastructure can scale up or down automatically to meet the current demand, providing the necessary resources when needed without manual intervention.
* By leveraging resource pooling, cloud services can provide efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solutions that meet the diverse needs of multiple users while ensuring high levels of performance and reliability.
#### Rapid Elasticity
* Resources are provisioned and released to adjust for changes in demand and consumption. This process may be automatic or manual. Server resources in a traditional model are purchased as a capital expenditure, and whether or not those resources are efficiently utilized, their cost and capabilities are fixed. In some business models, resource needs change throughout the year. For example, retail demand is significantly higher during some parts of the year than others. With cloud-based computing, resources are dynamically allocated, making for far more efficient utilization of those resources. Servers that might have been underutilized for most of the year no longer need to be purchased and maintained.
* Rapid Elasticity is another key characteristic of cloud services that emphasizes the ability to rapidly and dynamically scale resources up or down to meet fluctuating demand. This capability allows cloud users to quickly provision and release resources as needed, providing agility and cost efficiency.
* Overall, Rapid Elasticity enables cloud services to deliver scalability, agility, cost efficiency, and resilience, empowering organizations to innovate, grow, and respond to market dynamics with greater flexibility and speed.
#### Measured Service
* Measured Service is a fundamental characteristic of cloud services, highlighting the ability to monitor, control, and report resource usage accurately.
*  This characteristic ensures that both the cloud provider and the customer can track resource consumption, optimize performance, and manage costs effectively.
*  Usage Monitoring:
*  Resource Tracking: Cloud providers automatically track the usage of resources such as storage, processing power, bandwidth, and active user accounts.
Granular Data: Detailed data is collected at various levels of granularity, allowing for precise measurement of how resources are being used.
*  Transparency and Accountability:
*  Usage Reports: Customers receive detailed reports on their resource usage, which can be accessed through dashboards or APIs. These reports provide transparency and help customers understand their consumption patterns.
Billing and Invoicing: Accurate measurement of resource usage ensures that customers are billed correctly according to their actual consumption, aligning costs with usage.
* Measured Service ensures that cloud services are transparent, accountable, and optimized, providing customers with the data they need to manage their resources efficiently and cost-effectively while enabling providers to deliver reliable and high-quality services.

# Cloud Computing Ecosystem
* A Cloud Ecosystem refers to the interconnected network of cloud computing services, solutions, technologies, and providers that collectively enable the delivery, management, and consumption of cloud resources and services.
### How a cloud ecosystem works
* The center of a cloud ecosystem is a public cloud provider. It might be an IaaS provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or a SaaS vendor such as Salesforce.
*  Radiating out from the center of the cloud are software companies that use the provider's anchor platform, as well as consultants and companies that have formed strategic alliances with the anchor provider.
### The benefits of a cloud ecosystem
* Companies can use a cloud ecosystem to build new business models.
*  It becomes relatively easy for a medical device manufacturer, for example, to launch a heart-monitoring service on its cloud service provider's cloud infrastructure and then sell the service alongside its main business of manufacturing heart monitors for hospitals.
*  In a cloud ecosystem, it is also easier to aggregate data and analyze how each part of the system affects the other parts.
*   For example, if an ecosystem consists of patient records, smart device logs and healthcare provider records, it becomes possible to analyze patterns across an entire patient population.
#### It’s important to understand that an ecosystem of participants defines the market. This ecosystem consists of three categories of players:
##### Consumers of Services
* These are the everyday end-users (like yourself or your colleagues) that use cloud services in their day-to-day business activities. They often may have little understanding of where the service resides or how it is designed; they simply need the capabilities to get the job done. Examples include:
* Microsoft OneDrive: OneDrive is a file hosting and synchronization service offered by Microsoft. It enables users to store and share files and access them from any device, including PCs, Macs, and mobile devices.

### Understanding Cloud Concepts
* Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.
* Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).
* Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is.
*  That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.
*  With an on-premises datacenter, you’re responsible for everything. With cloud computing, those responsibilities shift.
*  The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types (covered later in this learning path): infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).
*  IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity. On the other end of the spectrum, SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider.
*   PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer.

##### When using a cloud provider, you’ll always be responsible for:
* The information and data stored in the cloud
* Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
* The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization
* The cloud provider is always responsible for:
* The physical datacenter
* The physical network
* The physical hosts
* Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:
* Operating systems
* Network controls
* Applications
* Identity and infrastructure

## Define cloud models
* The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources
* three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.

#### Private cloud
* Let’s start with a private cloud. A private cloud is, in some ways, the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter. It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity. Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. Finally, a private cloud may be hosted from your on site datacenter. It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.

#### Public cloud
* A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

#### Hybrid cloud
* A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

####Azure Arc
Z* Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.
* Azure VMware Solution
* What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

# Describe the consumption-based model
* When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider. Capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx).
* CapEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
* In contrast, OpEx is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.
* Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don’t pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.

# Describe the benefits of using cloud services
### Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud
* When building or deploying a cloud application, two of the biggest considerations are uptime (or availability) and the ability to handle demand (or scale).
* High availability
* When you’re deploying an application, a service, or any IT resources, it’s important the resources are available when needed.
*  High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.
*  When you’re architecting your solution, you’ll need to account for service availability guarantees. Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).
### When you’re deploying an application, a service, or any IT resources, it’s important the resources are available when needed. High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.
### When you’re deploying an application, a service, or any IT resources, it’s important the resources are available when needed. High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.

### Scalability
* Another major benefit of cloud computing is the scalability of cloud resources. Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand.
* The other benefit of scalability is that you aren't overpaying for services. Because the cloud is a consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use. If demand drops off, you can reduce your resources and thereby reduce your costs.
* Scaling generally comes in two varieties: vertical and horizontal. Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources. Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.

* Vertical scaling
* With vertical scaling, if you were developing an app and you needed more processing power, you could vertically scale up to add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine.
* Conversely, if you realized you had over-specified the needs, you could vertically scale down by lowering the CPU or RAM specifications.

* Horizontal scaling
* With horizontal scaling, if you suddenly experienced a steep jump in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out (either automatically or manually).
* For example, you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out.
* In the same manner, if there was a significant drop in demand, deployed resources could be scaled in (either automatically or manually), scaling in.

# Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud
* cloud features support governance and compliance
* Things like set templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements.
* Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies.
* Depending on your operating model, software patches and updates may also automatically be applied, which helps with both governance and security.
*  If you want maximum control of security, infrastructure as a service provides you with physical resources but lets you manage the operating systems and installed software, including patches and maintenance.
*   If you want patches and maintenance taken care of automatically, platform as a service or software as a service deployments may be the best cloud strategies for you.

# Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud
* A major benefit of cloud computing is the manageability options.
###  two types of manageability for cloud computing 
* Management of the cloud
* Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:
* Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
* Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
* Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
* Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

* Management in the cloud
* Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:
* Through a web portal.
* Using a command line interface.
* Using APIs.
* Using PowerShell.

#  cloud service types
## Describe Infrastructure as a Service
*  it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources.
*  In an IaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security.
*  You’re responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on.
*  With IaaS, you’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that
* The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet. You’re responsible for installation and configuration, patching and updates, and security.

* Describe Platform as a Service
* Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service).
*  In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet.
*  They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution.
*  In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.
*   PaaS is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.
*   PaaS splits the responsibility between you and the cloud provider.
*   The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet, just like in IaaS.
*    In the PaaS model, the cloud provider will also maintain the operating systems, databases, and development tools. Think of PaaS like using a domain joined machine: IT maintains the device with regular updates, patches, and refreshes.
* Depending on the configuration, you or the cloud provider may be responsible for networking settings and connectivity within your cloud environment, network and application security, and the directory infrastructure.
* Development framework: PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create an Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.
* Analytics or business intelligence: Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data, finding insights and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions.

### Describe Software as a Service
* Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application.
* Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation.
* While the SaaS model may be the least flexible, it’s also the easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of technical knowledge or expertise to fully employ.
* SaaS is the model that places the most responsibility with the cloud provider and the least responsibility with the user.
* In a SaaS environment you’re responsible for the data that you put into the system, the devices that you allow to connect to the system, and the users that have access. Nearly everything else falls to the cloud provider. The cloud provider is responsible for physical security of the datacenters, power, network connectivity, and application development and patching.
* Some common scenarios for SaaS are:

* Email and messaging.
* Business productivity applications.
* Finance and expense tracking.
* Which cloud service type is most suited to a lift and shift migration from an on-premises datacenter to a cloud deployment?
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
* With an IaaS service type, you can approximate your on-premises environment, making a lift-and-shift transition to the cloud relatively straightforward.
* You should be getting the idea that cloud computing means that everything — from computing power to computing infrastructure and from applications and business processes to personal collaboration — can be delivered to you as a service. To be operational in the real world, the cloud must be implemented with common standardized processes and automation.

# Cloud Components and Clients
* The first component is the client platform from which the cloud services are being accessed.
* The second is the data center where the cloud services are being hosted.
* The final component is the network connection between those two points.
* Cloud Service Component
* CSP data center  - Hosts cloud services
* Client - means of access to cloud services for consumer
* Network- Path between cloud services and client devices
* Leading cloud service providers (CSPs), like Microsoft and Amazon, operate a vast network of data centers worldwide. These data centers are designed with redundancy, ensuring reliable power supply, internet connectivity, and physical security.
*  It is within these data centers that cloud services are hosted, providing a range of functionalities.
*  The cloud service infrastructure can be managed internally by a single organization for its own use or managed by a CSP that provides services to many organizations. These two models can be combined into a hybrid solution.
*  The cloud service infrastructure can be managed internally by a single organization for its own use or managed by a CSP that provides services to many organizations. These two models can be combined into a hybrid solution:
*  Public cloud:  A CSP owns the cloud deployment and allocates its resources to external, unaffiliated customers. Those customers share the public cloud’s resources without knowing precisely where their data is in relation to that of any other organization.
*  Private cloud:  Services are provided to only a single organization.
*  Hybrid cloud:  There is a combination of two or more private, public, or community deployments.
